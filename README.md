# Pattern Printer Project

## Overview

The **Pattern Printer Project** is a Java application designed to demonstrate the generation of various text-based patterns using user-defined inputs. This project encapsulates the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java and showcases the ability to interactively collect user input and generate outputs based on this input. The application utilizes classes and methods effectively to promote code reusability and clarity. 

The primary objective of this project is to help users learn about pattern generation in programming while also providing a foundation for understanding class structures, methods, and user input handling in Java.

## Features

- **Multiple Pattern Options**: Users can choose to print different patterns, including right and left triangles, based on their inputs.
- **Dynamic Input Handling**: The application collects user inputs for the number of rows and the string to be used in the patterns. This allows for flexible and interactive usage.
- **Extensible Code Structure**: The project is designed in a modular fashion, making it easy to add new patterns or modify existing functionalities.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The console-based interface is straightforward, guiding users through the process of entering inputs and generating patterns.
- **Error Handling**: The program includes basic error handling for user inputs to ensure a smooth user experience.

## Installation

To set up the **Pattern Printer Project** on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use a package manager like SDKMAN or Homebrew.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal and run the following command to clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Arup-Sarkar-24/Java_Patterns_Games.git

3. **Usage**:
    Once the application is running, you will be presented with options to print various patterns. Here’s how to use the application:

    Select a Pattern: You will be prompted to enter a number corresponding to the pattern you want to print.
    Input Rows: After selecting a pattern, you will be asked to enter the number of rows you wish to print. Make sure the number of rows is greater than 0.
    Input Character: You will then enter a string that will be used to print the pattern.
    View the Output: The application will generate and display the selected pattern based on your inputs.
    Repeat or Exit: After displaying the pattern, you can either choose to print another pattern or exit the application by entering 0.

4. **Example Output**:
    Available methods:
1 -> leftTrianglePattern
2 -> rightTrianglePattern
Enter a number (1-2) to call a method, or 0 to exit: 1
Enter number of rows: 5

Enter a string: *
